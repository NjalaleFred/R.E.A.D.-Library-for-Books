# R.E.A.D. - Library for Books 

Welcome to "R.E.A.D. - Digital Library for Book Lovers"! Our motto is simple, "Reading Is Fundamental", and we believe that reading opens up new worlds, enhances creativity, and promotes lifelong learning. That's why we've created this platform to make it easier for you to obtain books online and inspire you to read more.

## Features

With our application, you can:

1. Search for your favorite books in our extensive database that covers various genres, including fiction, mystery, horror, and much more.
2. Share your favorite books with our community by adding them to our database, so others can discover and borrow them.
3. Borrow as many books as you want, and we'll automatically set the due date three days from the borrowing date.

## Project Setup

Our app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We've also used CSS to style the app and make it visually appealing. Finally, we've deployed the app using Netlify, a cloud computing platform.

## Getting Started

To get started, use our search and filter form to find the book you're looking for. Alternatively, you can browse our collection by clicking on the "Home" button at the top of the page. You can also borrow a book or add a new one using the buttons in the navigation bar.

Visit our live application at `https://chimerical-liger-851b4f.netlify.app/` to start exploring our library and discover new worlds through reading.

We hope you enjoy your time here and discover your next favorite book!
